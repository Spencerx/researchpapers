# Research Papers

This is just a slightly annotated, semi-currated, list of OpenFlow/SDN or
general networking research that someone in our group finds interesting. We try
to read 1-2 papers each week and discuss them in our weekly paper discussion
meeting, which is conducted over google hangouts. Anyone is welcome to add
suggested readings to our list.
